            <span class="name">Grains</span> provide the fermentable sugars that contribute to a beer's alcohol content, color, body and flavor. Common brewing grains include barley, wheat, rice, rye and oats. Some grains, known as "malts," are germinated and dried to produce enzymes that convert the grain's starches to sugar. Unmalted grains can also be used.

            <span class="name">Hop flowers</span> add bitterness and flavor to beer, and help balance the sweetness from malted grains. Hops are a relatively recent addition to the brewing process &mdash; records show they've only been used for about 500 years. For thousands of years before that, brewers relied on other flavoring ingredients, such as fruits and flowers.

            <span class="name">Yeasts</span> are microorganisms that can convert sugars into alcohol. Thousands of yeast strains can be found in everyday life, but brewers only use strains that contribute specific characteristics to a beer. Generally, brewers use two kinds: ale and lager yeasts.

            <span class="name">Water</span> makes up more than 90 percent of beer. Different water sources have different chemical properties. "Soft" water is low in minerals and bicarbonates and produces clean beers, such as pilsners. "Hard" water may be better suited for hoppy or dark beers. Brewers can adjust water chemistry by adding or filtering out certain minerals.
