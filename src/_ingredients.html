          <h3>Grain</h3>
          <p>
            Grains add fermentable sugars to a beer that contribute to the alcohol content, color, body and flavor of the beer. Common grains used in brewing are barley, wheat, rice, rye and oats. Malted and unmalted grains are used in brewing &mdash; malting is the germination and kilning of grain, creating enzymes that convert starches to sugar.

          <h3>Hops</h3>
          <p>
            Hops add bitterness and flavor when boiled in a beer that help balance the sweetness from malted grains. Hops are a somewhat recent addition to the brewing process &mdash; records showing that they've only been used for about half a millennium. Before that, brewers relied on other local ingredients in beer, such as fruits and flowers.

          <h3>Yeast</h3>
          <p>
            Yeast are microorgranisms that convert sugars into alcohol during fermentation. Thousands of different yeast strains can be found in everyday life, but brewers take great care to isolate and use strains that contribute desired characteristics to a beer. Generally, there are two types of yeast the brewers use: ale and lager yeasts.

          <h3>Water</h3>
          <p>
            Water makes up more than 90 percent of beer. Different water sources have varying chemical profiles. "Soft" water that is low in minerals and bicarbonates produces clean beers, such as pilsners. "Hard" water may be better suited for hoppy or dark beers. Water chemistry can be adjusted with mineral additions and filtration.
