    <div class="section-chatter">It takes weeks to brew a batch of beer. While homebrewing equipment looks a bit different from the setups of large breweries, the steps to make beer &mdash; brewing, fermentation and carbonation &mdash; are universal.</div>

        1. Hot water and crushed grains are combined to produce a mash. Activated by heat, enzymes in the grains convert starches to fermentable sugars. The ideal temperature for conversion usually falls between 148 and 158 degrees Fahrenheit, although some brewers mash at lower temperatures to convert other, more complex starches.

        2. Grains are separated from the mash, and the remaining liquid wort is boiled and sterilized. Hops are added at several stages of this boil &mdash; early hops additions impart bitterness, whereas later additions provide flavor and aroma.

        3. The wort is then chilled to temperatures hospitable to yeast &mdash; typically a little cooler than room temperature. Yeast is added, which converts sugars into alcohol, carbon dioxide and other byproducts. This fermentation process can take several weeks or longer.

        4. After the beer has finished fermenting, it's filtered out, chilled, carbonated and left to condition for another one to six weeks. The beer can then be bottled, kegged or served directly from a "brite tank,‚Äù as is often done in breweries.
