        Hot water and crushed grains are combined in a "mash tun." Enzymes in the grains convert starches to fermentable sugars, with the majority of conversion happening around 148 to 158 degrees Fahrenheit.

        The "wort" &mdash; water, fermentable sugars, proteins, amino acids and minerals &mdash; is separated from the grain and boiled in a kettle to sterilize it. Hops are added at different stages of the boil &mdash; early additions impart mostly bitterness and late additions impart mostly aroma.

        The wort is chilled to temperatures that yeast survive and thrive in &mdash; typically a little cooler than room temperature. Yeast cells added to the wort consume the fermentable sugars, creating alcohol, CO2 and other byproducts. Fermentation can take several weeks, or longer.

        After the beer has finished fermenting, it's separated from yeast cells and other particles and filtered, chilled and carbonated. The beer conditions and matures over one to six weeks. The beer can then be packaged in kegs or bottles, or served directly from a "brite tank" in breweries.
